**Plan**
- Map JavaScript/JSON surface: gather inventory, count files, estimate LOC.
- Read mandated core modules and notes; capture architecture, data flow, UX hooks.
- Pattern-scan for security/perf/error smells; log exact refs.
- Synthesize DEEPSEARCH → DEEPTHINKING → INTERNET RESEARCH findings into final report.

Will update after the inventory + file review.
